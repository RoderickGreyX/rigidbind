# rigidbind

Open source modular connection specification for metal components. Especially kinky ones.

## What is rigidbind?

It's a plug-and-socket standard for allowing items to be quickly joined together in a variety
of ways.

It is:

- Simple: the basic designs can be executed with ordinary metal shop tooling, no CNC needed.
- Standard: there are a few key design elements and measurements that apply to every rigidbind item.
- Shared: these elements and measurements are freely available to the community, not patented nor
  patentable.
- Open Source: these design elements and measurements are documented here under a Creative
  Commons license. 

## Why is rigidbind?

Rigidbind was inspired by frustration with the state of metal bondage equipment in the world.

Metal bondage equipment as generally available now (early 2022) is generally constructed as
monolithic pieces, that can't be converted to other uses, and that won't generally fit a range
of people very well. For example, this spreader bar:

This is a lovely item. But it will only fit someone who has _both_ a neck _and_ wrists that are
almost exactly the size of this piece. There is no adjustability.

As another example, these cuffs:

These can only be chained together with loose chain, never rigidly. If you had a set of these
that fit you perfectly, you wouldn't be able to use them as a rigid yoke like the one above.

The core idea of rigidbind is _separate modular pieces that lock together quickly, rigidly,
and interchangeably._ So you can get one set of personal items (cuffs, collar, etc.) that
actually fit you beautifully, and then plug and lock them into all kinds of other gear. Think
of it as a "metal bondage kit" and you're on to something.

## How does rigidbind?

Rigidbind is a plug-and-socket connection standard.

### The rigidbind plug

The core design element of rigidbind is the rigidbind plug. In the US/UK rigidbind specification,
it is simply:

- A one inch long section of 3/4 inch diameter solid metal tube, with 1/4 inch holes drilled
  perpendicularly through the center.

### The rigidbind sockets

The basic pattern for rigidbind sockets (in the US/UK specification) is: any metal item with a
25/32-inch hole (e.g. 1/32 inch more than the 3/4 inch diameter of the plug), and a separate
and perpendicular 9/32-inch pair of holes (e.g. 1/32 inch more than the 1/4 inch diameter of the
holes in the plug).

Simply put: you put the plug in the socket, then put a pin or a padlock through the socket and
plug together. Now you have an instant rigid connection that will not rotate or slide in any
direction.
