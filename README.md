# rigidbind

Open source modular connection specification for metal components. Especially kinky ones.

## What is rigidbind?

It's a plug-and-socket standard for allowing items to be quickly joined together in a variety
of ways.

It is:

- Simple: the basic designs can be executed with ordinary metal shop tooling, no CNC needed.
- Standard: there are a few key design elements and measurements that apply to every rigidbind item.
- Open Source: these design elements and measurements are documented here under a Creative
  Commons license. 

## Why is rigidbind?

Rigidbind was inspired by frustration with the state of metal bondage equipment in the world.

Metal bondage equipment as generally available now (early 2022) is generally constructed as
monolithic pieces, that can't be converted to other uses, and that won't generally fit a range
of people very well. For example, this spreader bar:

This is a lovely item. But it will only fit someone who has _both_ a neck _and_ wrists that are
almost exactly the size of this piece. There is no adjustability.

As another example, these cuffs:

These can only be chained together with loose chain, never rigidly. If you had a set of these
that fit you perfectly, you wouldn't be able to use them as a rigid yoke like the one above.

The core idea of rigidbind is _separate pieces that lock together quickly and rigidly._ So you
can get one set of personal items (cuffs, collar, etc.) that actually fit you beautifully, and
then plug and lock them into all kinds of other gear.

## How does rigidbind?

Rigidbind is a plug-and-socket connection standard.

### The rigidbind plug

The core design element of rigidbind is the rigidbind plug. In the US/UK rigidbind specification,
it is simply:

- A one inch long section of 3/4 inch diameter solid metal tube, with 1/4 inch holes drilled
  perpendicularly through the center.
